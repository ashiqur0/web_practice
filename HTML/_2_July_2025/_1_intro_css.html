CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading: means, falling water from, like
size = 10px; ❌
size = 15px; ❌
size = 20px; ✅
If you write more than one different styles for the same tag then the last one will work.

CSS can do:
1. It gives color to the web page
2. Changes Position
3. Can do a little bit of animation and many more

CSS Rules:
Ex. p {color:red};
Here, p = selector and {attribute:value} = declaration

How to use CSS?
1. Inline CSS.  Ex, <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a blue heading</h1>

2. Internal CSS.Ex,
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color:blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a blue heading</h1>
</body>

3. External CSS. Write Code in different file.
